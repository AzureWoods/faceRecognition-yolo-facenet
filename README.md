# Real-time Facial Recognition using YOLO and FaceNet

## Description
We implemented a small real-time facial recognition system, it will use camera to take pictures and render a real-time video to tell if the people in front of the camera is someone in our database (with his/her name as label) or someone unknown. The main algorithms we used are **YOLO v3** (You Only Look Once) and **FaceNet**.
* YOLO v3 is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm. The published model recognizes 80 different objects in images and videos. However, we only use YOLO to detect faces in our project. For more details about YOLO v3, you check this [paper](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf).
* FaceNet develops a deep convolutional network to learn a mapping from face images to a compact Euclidean space where distances
directly correspond to a measure of face similarity, and it uses **triplet-loss** as its loss function. If you want to know more about the details of [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf) and [triplet-loss](https://omoindrot.github.io/triplet-loss).

By the way, this is a final project of course EECS-496 (Advanced Deep Learning) at Northwestern University.

## Available Funtions
* **Face Alignment:** We have two versions of algorithms to detect and crop the faces in a picture â€” MTCNN and YOLO v3.
* **Training on FaceNet:** You can either train your model from scratch or use a pre-trained model for transfer learning. The loss function we use is triplet-loss.
* **Real-time Facial Recognition:** We use opencv to render a real-time video after facial recognition and labeling.

## Configuration
* OS: Windows 10
* GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060
* CUDA TOOLKIT: v10.0
* cuDNN SDK: v7.5 (corresponding to CUDA TOOLKIT v10.0)
* Python: 3.x
* tensorflow-gpu: 1.13.1

We successfully build this system in windows, but we are not sure if it will work under other operating system like Linux or Mac OS. However, all the repos we refer to can work under Linux, so we think Linux is also available.

## Usage

We only provide Windows version here, you can change the command for Linux.

1. **Face Alignment.**

     You can use either ```align_dataset_mtcnn.py``` or ```align_dataset_yolo_gpu.py```.
     
     First, use ```get_models.sh``` in \align\yolo_weights\ to get the pre-trained model of YOLO if you want to use YOLO version. (The bash file only work under Linux, I will provide link for downloading directly later.)
     
     Then create a folder in \align and name it as "unaligned_faces", put all your images in this folder. In \align\unaligned_faces, one person has one folder with his/her name as folder name and all his/her images should be put in the corresponding folder. 
     
     Finally run
     ```bash
     $ python align_dataset_mtcnn.py
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     $ python align_dataset_yolo_gpu.py
     ```
     
     The result will be generated in \aligned_faces folder, copy all the results to /output folder for later use.
     
2. **Training**

     * If you want to directly use a pre-trained model for facial recognition, just skip this step.
     * If you want to implement a tranfer learning with a pre-trained model and your own dataset, you need to first download this pre-trained [model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5MzpY9kBtDVZ2RpVDYwWmxoSUk/edit), put it in /models and unzip it. Make sure that the directory /models/20170512-110547 has 4 files.
       
       Then run
       ```bash
       $ python train_tripletloss.py
       ```
     
       The trained model will be in the /models/facenet.
